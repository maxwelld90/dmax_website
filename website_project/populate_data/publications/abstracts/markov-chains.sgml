<p>For improving the effectiveness of <em>Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)</em>, a system should minimise the search time by guiding the user appropriately. As a prerequisite, in any search situation, the system must be able to estimate the time the user will need for finding the next relevant document.</p>

<p>In this paper, we show how Markov models derived from search logs can be used for predicting search times, and describe a method for evaluating these predictions. For personalising the predictions based upon a few user events observed, we devise appropriate parameter estimation methods. <strong>Our experimental results show that by observing users for only 100 seconds, the personalised predictions are already significantly better than global predictions.</strong></p>
