<p>Logging user interactions is fundamental to capturing and subsequently analysing user behaviours in the context of web-based <em>Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)</em>. However, logging is often implemented within experimental apparatus in a piecemeal fashion, leading to incomplete or noisy data. To address these issues, we present the Log<strong>UI</strong> logging framework. We use (now ubiquitous) contemporary web technologies to provide an easy-to-use yet powerful framework that can capture virtually any user interaction on a webpage. Log<strong>UI</strong> removes many of the complexities that must be considered for effective interaction logging.</p>
