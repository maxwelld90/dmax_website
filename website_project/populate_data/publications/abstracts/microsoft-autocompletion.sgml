<p>Query Autocompletion (QAC) systems are interactive tools that assist a searcher in entering a query given a partial query prefix. Existing QAC research &mdash; with a number of notable exceptions &mdash;relies upon large existing query logs from which to extract historical queries. These queries are then ordered by some ranking algorithm as candidate completions, given the query prefix.</p>

<p>Given the numerous search environments (e.g. enterprises, personal or secured data repositories) in which large query logs are unavailable, the need for synthetic &mdash; or generative &mdash; QAC systems will become increasingly important. Generative QAC systems may be used to augment traditional query-based approaches, and/or entirely replace them in certain privacy sensitive applications. Even in commercial Web search engines, a significant proportion (up to 15%) of queries issued daily have never been seen previously, meaning there will always be opportunity to assist users in formulating queries which have not occurred historically.</p>

<p>In this paper, we describe a system that can construct generative QAC suggestions within a user-acceptable timeframe (~58ms), and report on a series of experiments over three publicly available, large-scale question sets that investigate different aspects of the system's performance.</p>
