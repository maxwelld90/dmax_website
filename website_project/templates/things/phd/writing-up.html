                        <p><strong>This page puts together different thoughts, tips and quotes from myself and others to give you a better understanding of the PhD writeup process.</strong> I think it's fair to say that for most people, writing up a PhD thesis is probably one of the most intense, drawn-out things that they will ever do. Because of the sheer size (and complexity!) of the document you have to write, it can induce a significant amount of pressure and stress. I hope that the advice (or just being able to freely acknowledge to you that the process is difficult and time-consuming) can help someone, or provide some form of comfort. <strong>You are not alone, and you will be all the better off for ultimately succeeding, even though it may seem incredibly daunting at the start.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>I was asked to put together a presentation about my experiences of writing up my own PhD thesis. <a href="https://twitter.com/iadh/status/1128604512510410752" target="_blank">I gave the talk to PhD students</a> at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a>'s <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/" target="_blank">School of Computing Science</a> on May 15<sup>th</sup>, 2019. Those watching the talk said they appreciated the honesty &mdash; and also appreciated some of the advice that I gave. Of course, this was originally in presentation form &mdash; however, interest from further afield made me think it might be useful for someone if I spent some time writing down what I said, too!</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="highlight">Please also be aware that this was made with a <strong>STEM PhD</strong> in mind. As I'm a former University of Glasgow student, parts of this page are geared towards students in the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/scienceengineering/graduateschool/" target="_blank">College of Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a> &mdash; however, I did try to generalise where I could.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="highlight">I also submitted and defended a PhD thesis that was hundreds of pages long. It took a lot of time and effort to plan and write. Take the advice and what I write from here with a pinch of salt; your mileage will undoubtedly vary depending on what you're studying, where you're studying it, and what you are looking to achieve.</span></p>

                        <p>Doing a PhD sometimes feels awful. Many of my friends (and myself) admit to having suffered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">impostor syndrome</a>, where you continually think that your work is not good enough and that <em>you're a fraud.</em> <em>Yeah, it'll only be a matter of time before your supervisor realises that you're no good(!)</em>. Remember that it appears to be normal to think that way. I think (you can correct me if you think I'm wrong) that it's a sign of intelligence. The more you read, the more aware you are of how much you <em>haven't read, and thus don't know</em>. And because you realise that there is so much that you don't know, you feel stupid. How ironic. But don't let that get you down. Don't expect those feelings of inadequacy to fade away over time &mdash; you just get used to having them, I think. A very successful senior academic told me that even after 20-30 years as a successful academic, they still feel like they're <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/may/21/everyone-is-totally-just-winging-it" target="_blank">winging it</a> some of the time.

                            <span class="highlight"><span><strong>It's a Learning Process</strong></span></span> Several of my friends who are early on in their PhD have expressed dissatisfaction and disappointment in themselves that they cannot write a research paper by themselves. They say that their supervisors are doing a bit of 'hand holding' &mdash; such as fleshing out sections of a paper they're working on with their student. That's normal, and it's their job (as long as you are involved)! By going through this process a couple of times, <em>you learn how to do it yourself!</em> By the end of your PhD, you'll have learned enough to be able to go through the motions by yourself. A good supervisor will be heavily involved in your work at the beginning as you learn the ropes &mdash; just as I show on the graph. He or she should take a backseat over time, leaving you in control. <em>And trust me, by that point, you'll then be experienced enough to be in control!</em></p>
                            
                        <p>From my experience, I remember back in 2014 working with my supervisor every day on the <a href="{% url 'dmax_org_uk:publications-entry' 'temporal-delays' %}" target="_blank">first full paper</a> I got published (and <a href="https://twitter.com/sw_mackie/status/504607153433616384?s=20" target="_blank">subsequently presented in Germany</a>). Towards the end of my PhD in early 2018, I thought of an idea, designed a methodology, ran the experiment and analysed the data all by myself. And <a href="{% url 'dmax_org_uk:publications-entry' 'ecir-serp-stopping' %}" target="_blank">that paper got published</a>, too. That's just the process. Don't feel bad that you'll need help at the start. You're a human, and you're learning every day.</p>
                        
                        <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight"><span><strong>Keep Going!</strong></span></span> You should be under no illusions that obtaining a PhD is a very tough thing to do. Although having intellect is obviously very important, one can argue it's more about showing that you have the strength, determination and depth to <em>keep going,</em> even when everything around you seems to be falling apart. Keep going through the tough times, and you'll be rewarded with some good times. And at the very end of the process, when you submit that document you've been working towards for <em>four-ish years</em> to your School or College for examination, it'll <a href="#reflecting"><em>feel so good.</em></a></p>

                        <p>When I was preparing content for the presentation I originally gave, I was acutely aware that someone could put their hand up and say something along the lines of <em>what you're saying is just your experience &mdash; how do we know it's not just you, or something that a lot of people went through, too?</em></p>
                        
                        <p>I was curious to see the answer to this, so I asked several of my friends who themselves were former STEM PhD students. I asked them to answer a couple of very high-level questions. I was trying to solicit <em>their thoughts</em> about <em>their experiences</em> when they were writing their PhD theses. You can see the four questions that I asked below, and the number of respondents. Note that for some, I followed up with further questions. Most of the participants were repaid with a pint of beer at the <a href="https://www.brelbar.com/" target="_blank">Brel beer garden</a>. I made a very unscientific scale, and, based on their answers, judged whether they were mainly positive or negative. My judgement of where they fit on the scale is shown below for each question.</p>

                        <p>Sitting down in front of my computer back in early 2018, I had Slack open. I was talking to my good friend who was in the same boat as me. We'd reached the end of our respective PhD programmes, and the time had come to write up. I'm super grateful that I had my friend to talk to as we both went through the process together, finishing only a few weeks apart. I think having someone who knew exactly what the other was feeling about everything was super helpful. Nevertheless, I remember him saying to me:</p>

To continue with the analogy, you'll need to cross rapids, climb mountains and scale back down the other side of each. Thinking about things literally, you may find that experiments may not produce the results you hope for. You encounter a problem that you spend weeks trying to solve, only to realise it's really not worth the effort. You will also most likely make mistakes at times which will mean having to do things again, and maybe once more after that for good measure. Around six months before your final submission date, you'll be probably be feeling tired and fed up &mdash; but hopeful, too. The hard work is almost over.</p>
                        
                        <p>Except it's really not. There's one more major challenge left, one that brings many people to their knees. <span class="highlight">It's writing up. It's your Everest.</span> As I'll talk about shortly, you should have been writing things as you go along, and you should have a heap of content which you can shape into something that resembles a thesis. But that's not an easy process. Staring before you is 8,848 metres that you need to ascend and descend before you reach the finishing line. And trust me, you can't take a shortcut around the side of this obstacle. There's no way around it. You have to climb, you have to <em>write</em>.</p>

                        <p>Towards the start of my writeup phase, I was feeling the pressure already. I remember thinking things along the lines of <em>"I have so much to do, I need to get on with the writing now."</em> I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night, finding the cogs in my brain turning rapidly. I was thinking about things like how I could structure that chapter, what I could say in response to this criticism of my work, and so on and so forth. With hindsight, that nervous energy was a blessing in disguise: it gave me the kick up the backside I needed to get on with the planning and exploring that I needed to do before I properly began writing properly. From my experience (and others who have talked to me), <span class="highlight">it's crucial that you properly plan and test the waters before you begin the full-on writeup effort.</span></p>

                        <p>You should roughly know when to start writing. I guess this varies hugely depending on how long your thesis should be, where you're studying it, and how fast you can write.

                            I should have defined my thesis topic earlier in my PhD. And I should have stayed on that topic a bit more closely. I should also have looked at the thesis structure more earlier on in the PhD to better understand the expected deliverable... This lack of understanding drew out the process by months, and made life so much more stressful.
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>Another one of my friends found himself in the same basic trap: lots of really good work, but a bit of an uphill task to join everything together. It took this second individual at least <em>three months</em> to find that good narrative that made everything fit together. Be warned: it can take a while, especially if it is not immediately obvious!</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            I had different parts/components in my PhD research, which made it difficult to form a coherent story. This caused problems when writing up my thesis. For example, it was not easy to write a good thesis statement to cover all the parts. If I could go through it again, I would like to have a coherent story and statement at the beginning of the PhD and then validate them.
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>What should you produce, though? What is the deliverable? This again heavily depends upon where you're studying. In the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_167493_en.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">College of Science and Engineering at the University of Glasgow</a>, you need to write a PhD thesis that provides a clear narrative &mdash; and ideally will demonstrate the advancement of your methodology as you progress through your thesis. Each chapter needs to flow nicely onto the next, rather than individual chapters sitting independently from one another. Working out what story to tell is probably one of the most difficult things to get right for your thesis, especially if you have a lot of disjointed experiments. <a href="#writing">More on this later.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>At a minimum, you should consider having your <strong>thesis chapter plan</strong>, your <strong>thesis template</strong> and your <strong>backup plan</strong> all sorted before you start writing. I discuss each of these below.</p>
                        
                        </div>
                        <div class="pwrapper partial">
                        
                        <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight"><strong>Your Chapter Plan</strong></span> Having a chapter plan to work with &mdash; even a draft &mdash; was probably one of the most useful tools that I had at my disposal during my writeup, as <a href="#writing">I'll discuss later on</a>. Being able to produce one of these for your progress reviews (if you have them) is probably going to also be a very useful way of showing your supervisor/examiners that you know what you want to do. A rough chapter plan was useful for helping me to sort out my thoughts for what I wanted to write. I think I went through four iterations of rough plans before arriving at one I felt comfortable to discuss with my supervisor. <em>Four!</em> I had so many ideas and there were so many ways to present what I had done that it was a major challenge to work out the best way to do it. When starting with a blank slate, you'll probably panic a bit, too. Just stay calm. You've done a lot of work, and with a calm mind, you'll be able to start lifting things from your previous work and bring them into your thesis.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">A chapter plan was crucial for me &mdash; but it takes several iterations and a lot of thought to get it ready.</span>
                        
                        <p>Start with the basic five chapters, and expand from there.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="standard">
                            <li><strong>Chapter 1</strong> <span class="highlight">Introduction</span> &mdash; introducing the problem area, your research questions and thesis statement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chapter 2</strong> <span class="highlight">Background/Prior Work</span> &mdash; discussing previous work related to what you want to solve, along with a discussion of the limitations of prior work which helps you further cement the credibility of what you want to do.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chapter 3</strong> <span class="highlight">Your Approach</span> &mdash; or your methodology. How did you run your experiments? Why did you do this over that?</li>
                            <li><strong>Chapter 4</strong> <span class="highlight">Your Experiments</span> &mdash; presenting your experimental results, perhaps over multiple chapters for each experiment. A consistent approach to your presentation and analysis will only count in your favour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chapter 5</strong> <span class="highlight">Conclusions</span> &mdash; an important chapter where you must bring all your findings together, discussing the implications for the future.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Apologies if that seems obvious, but starting with those five chapters helped me (with a little inspiration from prior theses, as I'll mention below) get a much better idea for how to structure my thesis. The concluding chapter, by the way, is where I think you will do most of the <em>philosophising</em> to earn your <em>Doctor of Philosophy</em> degree &mdash; you need to have a proper philosophical discussion about what you've found in your work, and where it's going to lead the field that your thesis has made a contribution to.</p>
                        
                        <p>To give you a concrete example, here's my final chapter plan. Over the four iterations, I also decided that I could split the chapters into four parts that closely mirror the basic structure above. Note that Part I munges together the introduction and background chapters.</p>

                        <p>Again, notice the similarity in the basic structure: I just found that certain things became so big and/or important that they <em>felt</em> like they deserved to be in their own chapter. You can only know that as you go through and write the damn thing! <span class="highlight">But you have the freedom to structure your thesis as you see fit.</span> For example, I found that splitting my background into two chapters &mdash; one about the broad area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval" target="_blank">Information Retrieval</a> and one more focused on my specialist area, stopping behaviours &mdash; worked pretty well. And the effort I put into making everything consistent meant I could write a <em>general methodology</em> chapter, an abstracted methodology for the experiment chapters. And the abstracted parts to my methodology (i.e. the things that were varied) were filled in in each experiment chapter. That was neat, and it saved a lot of duplication!</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Every thesis is different &mdash; but remember, you have relative freedom in terms of how you structure your own!</span>
                        
                        <p>As I alluded to earlier, you can find inspiration from other prior PhD theses &mdash; it's worth checking your university's library for prior examples. For example, the University of Glasgow Library has <a href="http://theses.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Enlighten</a> that allows you to search for prior Glasgow PhD theses. Go have a look at some in your field, and draw inspiration from them.</p>

Don't be disappointed with yourself if you find if your chapter plan has to change during the writeup. <em>It most likely will!</em></span> I didn't think of the abstracted methodology approach until much later on in the process, for example. However, with proper preparation and a thorough discussion about it with your supervisor, any changes will hopefully be minor &mdash; and will result in less work to readjust things later on. <span class="highlight">If you don't invest the time preparing <em>early on</em>, it'll be more painful for you <em>later on</em>.</span></p>

                        <p>Of course, what is required can be dictated by your university, too. You will want to check with them to make sure that everything you require is present. At Glasgow, the College of Science and Engineering have a <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_167493_en.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">document that tells you what you must include</a>.

                        <p>If you know how to use a typesetting system such as <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>, please, please, please use that. If you don't know how to use it, now may be the time to <a href="https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/" target="_blank">get used to it</a>. This is what such systems are designed for! Using a WYSIWYG editor such as Microsoft Word can prove to be a nuisance for such a large document &mdash; especially a STEM PhD thesis, highly likely to be full of illustrations, tables and so forth. We all know what happens <a href="https://twitter.com/gossipgriii/status/713425874167537664" target="_blank">when you try to move an image in Word...</a></p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Please consider using a typesetting system. They are there for a reason!</span>
                        
                        <p>Your university will also likely offer a template that you can use for your thesis. <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_513134_en.zip" target="_blank">Glasgow offers one</a>; you'll want to check with your university and obtain their template if you study elsewhere. The advantage of using such a template is that you know it complies with all the rules set out by your university on aspects such as margins, page numbering and so forth.</p>
                        
                        <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight"><strong>Going the Extra Mile</strong></span> You can of course, if your university permits, work on your own template. I call this <em>going the extra mile</em> because if you are prepared to invest the extra time in preparing your own template that complies with all the rules your university imposes, you can make something that really stands out from the rest. I'm not ashamed to admit that I did this, and am really proud of the <a href="http://bit.ly/modelling-search-and-stopping" target="_blank">outcome</a>! There are also several people I know who spent considerable effort making their thesis look really pretty, too &mdash; either by designing their own template or by drawing their own beautiful illustrations to visualise parts of their work. You might not be convinced with the extra investment required in order to do this &mdash; it's not for everyone &mdash; but trust me, <em>people will notice</em>.</p>

                        <p>However, be wary that going down this path can eat up your time. <span class="highlight">If you're a perfectionist, you'll find that you can invest ridiculous amounts of time playing around with the layout.</span> I probably spent a month on and off during my third year playing around with LaTeX and developing my own template. Some people will question my sanity here: but I digress. I learnt a lot about how the typesetting system works, and feel it was quite a valuable experience. It didn't impede my studies either, so I consider it to be a good thing to have done.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Under time pressure? Just write. Don't worry about this. Just get the thesis written.</span>
                        
                        <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight"><strong>The Backup Plan</strong></span> This is obvious, right? As a final thing to consider before you start writing, <span class="highlight"><strong>back your stuff up.</strong></span> You never know what's going to happen. Use a version control system to keep track of changes you make to your thesis. If you know how to use Git, make a private repository on <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and commit to that. Since <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/" target="_blank">Microsoft bought GitHub</a>, you can make free private repositories &mdash; so there's no excuse here.</p>
                        
                        <p>Your experiment data should also be backed up, too. Or at the very least, configuration files (if your apparatus is just computer programs). These data can add up quickly, and committing gigabytes to your Git repository is not a great idea. Consider cloud storage &mdash; or if that's still not enough or really viable, back things up physically with external hard disks.</p>

                        <p>I didn't want to lose anything, so my strategy was to set up my Git repository and commit my changes to that whenever a section was drafted. At the end of each day, I'd back up my complete PhD directory to an external hard drive, and two USB flash storage drives. These would be stored at home in different places. That's probably a little excessive, but I'd be very happy to have alternative copies of my work if something bad were to happen to my laptop <em>and</em> external hard disk!</p>

They are important; they keep the Graduate School in the loop with your progress, and they also facilitate the organisation of your final viva once everything has been submitted. If you don't submit forms on time, there could be repercussions for you &mdash; so <a href="#cose-dates">make sure you know what to submit, and when!</a></p>

                        <p>It's also important to remind you that it is <span class="highlight">your PhD, and therefore your responsibility to fill out paperwork.</span> If you don't, it may well be that nobody will come chasing after you for that elusive form. When you realise that the form needs to be completed, it may be too late &mdash; or significantly delay your final viva date. The College of Science and Engineering at Glasgow don't seem to remind you when forms need to be submitted, so make sure you know. <a href="#cose-dates">I'll come back to that shortly.</a></p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Filling out paperwork is your responsibility. It's your PhD, after all.</span>

                        <p>Making sure that you keep on top of your forms may seem like a blindingly obvious piece of advice to give, but you'd be surprised how difficult it can be to motivate yourself when you're neck deep in writing your thesis. You'll probably be frustrated that you have to deviate away from writing up and spending time filling out paperwork. This is a mentality that I unfortunately developed; and I know I was not alone. Hence why I think it's important to tell you: <span class="highlight"><strong>don't feel tempted to let your paperwork slide. It'll come back to bite you if you do.</strong></span> For me (and several others that I know), <span class="highlight">dealing with admin was one of the biggest contributors to stress and anxiety that I faced during my writeup period.</span> Here's a quote from my friend that backs this point up perfectly.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">If you don't take care of the admin side of things, you'll start stressing out about it. Don't repeat what I did.</span>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            The actual writeup wasn't stressful. The main cause of stress: feeling obliged to hit some arbitrary deadline (e.g. the four year limit). Think in advance: are you going to hit or not. If you are not 100&#37; confident, you probably won't. 
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        </div>
                        <div class="partial pwrapper">
                        
                        <p>Kind of a bit deflating, but probably true. As I said, this hits the nail on the head perfectly for me: <span class="highlight">I was hesitant to fill out forms because I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to hit the deadline, given the mountain of work I had to do at the time.</span> Filling out forms saying you're going to hit a deadline six months down the road is a very difficult thing to do because it's just so damn hard to grasp whether or not it's doable. It's like national politicians talking about spending billions here and billions there; the scale of spend at that level is just so large you can't really comprehend it. With your PhD writeup, it's unlike anything you've probably done before, so being able to confidently predict how long it'll take &mdash; and whether you'll be able to finish everything in time &mdash; is hard. <a href="#time">More on this later.</a></p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Don't repeat the mishtake I made here. Just do the paperwork. If you are really going to struggle, talk to your supervisor before you do.</span>
                        
                        <p>The <em>"arbitrary deadline"</em> is the four year limit imposed on students studying a PhD in the UK. I believe this was imposed because, in the past, many people were taking way too long to complete their PhDs. To try and curb students perhaps overstaying their welcome, <a href="https://www.ukri.org/about-us/our-councils/" target="_blank">research councils</a> imposed a four year limit on students. This is why at Glasgow (and elsewhere in the UK) it's such a strict rule &mdash; bad things can happen if you go over this time period. And it's probably why most scholarships are three and a half years long. Going the final six months unfunded is a strong incentive to finish up early!</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="highlight">This is why my advice to start writing up as soon as you can is so important &mdash; please don't cross that four year barrier if you're in the UK.</span> If you genuinely don't think you can submit before four years are up, you need to have a chat with your Graduate School as soon as possible. If you start writing early, you can get a better idea earlier on how long it'll take to do things, and thus avoid a disaster at the end. <a href="#time">I'll write about this later.</a></p>

                        <p>One way you can mitigate stress and anxiety about this is to be <span class="highlight">absolutely clear and upfront with your Graduate School about <em>when exactly your four year deadline is.</em></span> I wish I had done this earlier! After your third year progress review (or whenever you enter your final year of study), work out your four year deadline from the point at which you commenced your PhD studies. This is straightforward if you didn't go away anywhere (e.g. to do an internship). However, if you did, you'll need the paperwork you filled out when you left, and you'll be looking to add the time you were away to your original finishing date. Work out the date, e-mail it to your Graduate School, and reach an agreement as to when exactly it is. The sooner you do this, the better &mdash; you'll feel a little less stressed knowing that you have a concrete date to aim for. And having that date in the back of your mind will push you along to get stuff done, rather than freaking out wondering when it is.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Work out when your four year deadline is &mdash; at least one year in advance. You can thank me later.</span>

                        <p id="cose-dates">As a final thought here, I put together a graphic showing when Glasgow students studying in the College of Science and Engineering need to fill out and submit forms &mdash; along with the basic series of events that happen in the final six(ish) months. This was originally a slide in my presentation and was well received. There are some bullet points underneath that provide additional information. Note that the details are correct as of May 2019!</p>
                        
                        <p>Starting from your third year viva...</p>
                        
                        <ul class="standard">
                            <li><span class="highlight">You enter your final year.</span> At this point, you should have the basics ready to go, and know <em>exactly</em> when your final finishing date (or submission day on the graphic) is. You could submit your thesis at this point &mdash; if it's ready!</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Go thesis pending</span> No later than six months before submission day, you need to hand in your thesis pending form. This tells the College you no longer need to pay tuition fees because you are now writing up your thesis. Get writing seriously if you have not already! Note that you should have completed all of your major experiments by this point &mdash; but that doesn't mean to say you're out of the woods. You may still have to re-run some things in order to get things nice and consistent for <em>telling your story.</em></li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Intention to submit</span> Three months before your submission day, hand in your intention to submit form. This form commits you to submitting within three months of handing the form in. This is important because a lot of things start happening in the background, mostly to do with your viva date. The College and your supervisor start actively looking for an external examiner for you. If you fail to submit within three months of this date, you'll have a major headache to deal with.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Submission day</span> is a good day in your life, although very anticlimactic. As most things in life are. But when you get there, you should feel rightly proud of your achievement.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">The viva</span> You then have your final viva. Congratulations, I know you'll pass!</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Corrections</span> It's likely you will have some things to correct. Hopefully, your examiners will give you no more than a month to fix everything. Your corrections day (as I call it) is the date your examiners tell you to submit everything for re-evaluation. Hopefully, all will be fine.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Submitting the final copy</span> You then need to get your thesis printed off. Take it to a <a href="http://www.dadbookbinders.com/" target="_blank">bookbinder</a>. Submit one physical copy to the College. <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/research/enlighten/theses/" target="_blank">Deposit</a> your thesis online, too. When submitting your physical copy to the College, you will also need to hand in your thesis access declaration form. This will only be an issue if you make use of copyrighted material or material that may require an embargo. Talk to your supervisor about that.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">The end</span> Once everything has been satisfied, you will receive an award letter in the post. <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You can now graduate. Easy peasy, right?</li>

I started my writeup with several publications under my belt. From each of those publications, I had learned a little bit more about how to plan my research projects out properly.</p>
                        
                        <p>Writing my thesis however was a different ballgame &mdash; it was much more drawn-out than anything I had done previously, and given the increased size of chapters (when compared to sections of a research paper), these may require more time to write, too. Indeed, even if you are basing a chapter on something you've already written up, it can take <em>an age</em> to shape the narrative to fit the story of your thesis. That's something I had not done beforehand &mdash; and so I was in the dark regarding how long it could take.</p>
                        
                        <p>You also need to remember that you'll have other commitments that you need to deal with, too. Maybe working another job, or dealing with children. You need to remember that you have to sleep, eat, and occasionally relax, too. Not doing these things well can lead to all sorts of problems, <a href="#yourself">as I'll talk about later</a>. I was incredibly fortunate not to have to worry about financial issues as I was writing. I know that makes my experience perhaps somewhat different from others. I was lucky. I freely admit that now.</p>

That is why I keep repeating: <span class="highlight">start writing as soon as possible!</span> Give yourself the time buffer that will make things much more bearable.</p>

                        <p>Annoying as it is, I think it's vitally important to get a feel for how long it takes to get things done. Experiments should broadly be written up by your writeup phase, and analysis should really be done too; this is more about investing time and effort to figure out how long it takes to shape things up into a thesis.</p>

                        <p>At the start of your writeup phase, spend some time writing up a chapter &mdash; or at least a few sections of one &mdash; and be conscious of how long it's taking you to get <em>to a completed draft.</em> You can then begin to make more precise extrapolations as to how long it'll take you to get the next chunk of work completed, and so forth. I'm sure that you will find it much easier to work out how long things will take to plan.</p>

                        <p>I always thought that I hated the idea of Gantt charts. I realised during the writeup that I don't hate Gantt charts per se, but I hate being told to make one when I'm really unsure as to how long each activity will take. Be kind to yourself. Give yourself the time and flexibility to play around with figuring out how long things will take, then go make yourself a detailed Gantt chart based upon your experiences. You need time to develop that feeling or intuition. And this is something that people have told me has served them well in their careers since finishing up their PhD. Time management is crucial in any walk of life, let alone writing up a PhD thesis!</p>

You may encounter an unexpected stumbling block that means you have to spend a few weeks running an experiment again, for example. This happened to me twice. I realised that although my experiments were originally sound, <em>they really didn't fit well together and tell a coherent story.</em> Getting sidetracked like this is incredibly frustrating and upsetting, but you can again plan in a means to mitigate these unfortunate scenarios: <span class="highlight">slack time.</span></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="highlight">This is another reason why I have said so many times you should get writing as soon as you can. <strong>Things can (and probably will) happen that are very difficult to foresee.</strong></span> Cue a quote from one of my friends:</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            You know what it's like! You think it'll take you a day, but at the end of the week, you're still writing the same section. It's so frustrating. It just goes on and on. The one thing that I think we both learnt is that you slack time the hell out of things!
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Yeah &mdash; we (being my friend and me) both learnt this. If you think it's going to take you a day, give yourself an extra day of slack time. If you think it will take you a week, give yourself half a week slack time for that activity. That may be overly generous; it's better to have a safety net than to not. Realistically, you probably cannot schedule such generous slack time. Even if you could, would you yourself then begin to slack? Be wary of this. From your learning the ropes phase, you should also be aware of how long you <em>think</em> something will take, and how long it <em>actually</em> took to do.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Slack time is good. Try and add a little slack time for each chapter/major part of your writeup.</span>
                        
                        <p>Regardless of what you think, please do consider adding some slack time into your overall plan. My final Gantt chart had a full month of slack time for the final three chapters of my thesis. I used one and a half weeks of it. Again, better to have it than to not.</p>

                        <p>When you've got a rough chapter plan, get into writing. I always find it takes a very long time to get into the frame of mind to write well. But when I do, it kind of feels like a state of hypnosis. I just wanted to keep going, and the section I was writing was always on my mind. Even walking home in the evenings when I felt like I needed some downtime, I'd find my brain would still be thinking about it; still thinking about those little details that show you've really thought about what you are writing.</p>

                        <p>It was all-consuming, and this is definitely not something that was unique to me. Plenty of people who went through the experience expressed the same basic sentiment. As I'll talk about later, you'll probably change a bit as you work through your thesis, and if you have friends who are going through their writeup too, you will likely notice a change in their behaviour. It's tough. Think back to the message I had about <a href="#admin">keeping on top of admin</a>. Sounds obvious; when you're so engrossed in your writing, you probably don't even care about it (even though you <em>really</em> should).</p>
                        
                        <p>Don't forget to take breaks and remember to exercise, even though sometimes you'll just want to sit down and keep going. You do need to eat, socialise and sleep. That stuff can't stop, although it may mean that you will have to get away with doing less of the fun stuff you are used to.</p>
                        
                        <p>But a wee word of warning here: don't pressure or force yourself to sit down and write, especially at the beginning. Getting into the mentality of writing quickly and efficiently takes time. When you are there, you'll know. Words will effortlessly flow from your brain straight onto your computer's screen. When you aren't in that frame of mind, it'll be torturous. You'll be lambasting yourself for not doing things quickly, and force yourself to do something. When you read back what you wrote in that state of mind, it'll probably not be very good. You'll make yourself feel worse, and this turns into a vicious circle.</p>

Keep distractions to a minimum. Eventually after a week or so, you'll want to keep writing &mdash; and that's when everything starts to flow. It takes time, which is why I'll say again &mdash; start writing early to give yourself the space to do this! Don't get into that frame of mind, then disappear off for a week. That'll frustrate you even more, because you may find you have to get back into the writing mindset again when you return!</p>

It's been likened to <span class="highlight">mental torture</span> by one of my close friends. By my own admission (and those of others), it can be hard to get out of bed in the morning when all you have planned for the day ahead is <em>writing</em> &mdash; especially when that's all you've been doing for, say, the past two months.</p>

Apart from giving yourself breaks and allowing yourself a little downtime here and there, there are a few tricks that I learnt as I went along the process that definitely helped. When you finish drafting a section and/or a chapter, stop. Compile your PDF. And just sit there for a few minutes and <em>scroll through what you have done so far.</em> This sounds ridiculous! But it actually really helped and made me realise that <em>even though I feel like I am buried up to my eyeballs in work, I am making progress.</em> Remember the mountain analogy from the beginning? It's like stopping for breath and looking back at how far up you've climbed. Small goals. It is satisfying. It'll inspire you to keep going; to keep climbing. Challenge yourself to write another section! And another. And another. And another...</p>

                        <p>At the start of each day, don't fall out your bed in a depressed state and go <em>"oh crap, this is never going to end!"</em> Instead, I recommend that you sit down and highlight on your chapter plan a section that you're going to spend the day tackling. You might want to even invest some time (like I did) in writing a series of todos for the section you will be tackling. <em>"I need to write the introduction to this section. I know I have this data, but I need to regenerate the graph I had from before to include the standard errors here because I didn't have them before. That'll involve opening up the script I had before and doing some modifications. Then I'll need to take the narrative from my existing paper and move things around to make it fit with the flow of my thesis."</em> Something like that.

                        <p>By the end of my writeup, I had sheets and sheets of paper that was originally a printed copy of my chapter plan &mdash; but with heaps of additional other todo lists, all scrawled down, but importantly ticked off.

I fell down this trap when writing my first chapter: I quickly began to realise <em>"oh no, this is going to take several stabs to get it right!"</em> With hindsight, I don't know why I didn't immediately think this, but whatever. It's done now. Don't repeat that mistake!</p>

                        <p>To reiterate, the idea of making a thesis flow means that everything you discuss has a purpose, and is linked to other components. You can help this by presenting a similar set of experiments where you change as few variables as possible &mdash; or build up the complexity of your experiments as you progress through the chapters of your thesis. Consistent reporting of results (e.g. consistent colour schemes and other presentational aspects) will help you, too, and gives the effect of a highly polished piece of work. Maybe you'll even want to go further than you did before and compare results from one chapter to another. If you base your chapters on prior studies, it may be unlikely that you will have bridged them before, so this would require a lot of time and effort to do.</p>

These take time to get right and obviously require a lot of reading (if you haven't done this already, but you really should have). Be wary of including stuff in the background chapters just because you feel you have to, or because others have. Ask yourself: <em>do I make reference to x later on in my thesis?</em> If not, you probably don't really need to include it. However, if it lays the foundations for something you <em>do</em> utilise, maybe it's worth discussing at a high level, before moving onto the more relevant work. I learnt a lesson here: I included an in-depth discussion of some Information Retrieval concepts that I didn't really make use of later on. Surprise, surprise: my supervisor told me to take that section out.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Background chapters can take longer to write up than your experimental chapters. Don't think you need to include <strong>everything</strong> &mdash; think sensibly about what you rely on.</span>

                        <p>Also, make sure that every chapter serves a purpose. Don't leave a chapter hanging by itself in isolation. Don't have a chapter in your thesis talking about something totally different from the main narrative of your work. If you want to include it, find an argument to include it. You may find that it could better serve you by taking it out altogether. Not everything that I worked on during my time as a PhD student made it into my final thesis!</p>

Remember the <a href="#survey">unscientific survey</a> that I conducted back at the start? Most people I asked said that they hated the experience at the time. However, the experience is also incredibly rewarding &mdash; and everybody looked back on it favourably (including me!).

Do I really need to invest all of this time in making it flow nicely, and so forth?</em> Someone once remarked that they wanted to get away with doing as little as possible to get their PhD. My response to someone like that would be to say <em>"enjoy your difficult viva, then."</em> It's likely that if you don't invest the necessary time and effort, you're doing it wrong. Do the best you can. Submitting something quickly may well mean that you you haven't properly considered things like thesis structure. If the thesis structure isn't great, it shows to your examiner(s) you haven't put enough thought into it. Their reaction won't be overly positive. That's my guess, anyway, judging from things I have heard about other people's experiences.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">If you don't invest the effort in making everything flow, your viva may be more intense than it needs to be.</span>
                        
                        <p>If your examiner(s) think that, then it's a pretty sure thing you'll be squirming in your viva. You'll probably end up with some major corrections to work on, or worse still, be asked to resubmit at a later date. This is nightmare scenario territory. <span class="highlight">My argument here is that if you invest the time now, you'll reap the rewards later. If you don't invest the time now, you'll have to fix it up properly post-viva. Either way, I don't think you can get away with doing a half-assed job. Even doing "the minimum", whatever that is, would probably set you in for a more challenging viva.</span> You need to invest the required time and effort <em>at some point.</em> You might as well do things properly and do everything to the best of your abilities <em>before</em> your viva!</p>

                        <p>Looking after yourself is important in any challenging scenario. Writing up is no exception. Although I already have highlighted several really important things you should continue to do &mdash; such as taking breaks and exercising &mdash; there are a few things that I think are worth discussing in a bit more detail &mdash; specifically, what I (and others) felt during the writeup phase. If I can describe the feelings and emotions that I went through, I hope it'll make it less scary for someone else when they read this &mdash; to know they are not alone in thinking whatever thoughts they have about their work and themselves.</p>
                        
                        <p>But first, let's make something clear. Stress can at times provide you with that push you need to get stuff done. I'd like to think there's broadly two distinct kinds of stress.</p>
                        
                        <ul id="writeup-stress-grid-container">
                            <li id="writeup-short-term-stress"><span class="header"><strong>Short-Term Stress</strong></span></li>
                            
                            <li id="writeup-long-term-stress"><span class="header"><strong>Long-Term Stress</strong></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Short-term stress is what we are used to in our daily lives. It doesn't last for too long. Perhaps you get stressed out before you stand up and give a presentation. Or, like in the illustration above, you are a caveman who has to deal with an imminent threat to your life. Whatever it is, the release of the stress hormones let you deal with the situation at the time. It's probably a good thing on balance. It keeps you going. You feel <em>alive.</em></p>
                        
                        <p>What I want to talk about mostly however is long-term stress. Writing up your thesis, compared to other activities that you have done, can last a <em>very long time.</em> Can you see where I am going with this? You might have experienced long-term stress before when writing up your honours dissertation, or something akin to that. That might have only lasted a few weeks to a month, however. PhD writeups can take considerably longer than that, as I <a href="#duration">showed you earlier</a>.</p>

                        <p><span class="highlight">Your writeup phase has the potential to have a negative impact on your mental and physical health.</span> Working under such pressure over such a prolonged period will most likely lead to some form of issue, albeit temporarily. Several individuals I know were hospitalised for a short while due to the effects of stress on their bodies. Some were keen to let me know that they reached out for mental health support &mdash; either from friends and family, or from a professional.</p>
                        
                        <p>While I and others found it to be tough, <span class="highlight">the only way to get past it <em>is to work through it.</em></span> You can attempt to mitigate any negative effects by doing your best to listen to your body when you know things are getting a bit too much. I know I also said you shouldn't stop, and you should keep going &mdash; but I also said you should <span class="highlight">start writing early.</span> Starting to write early means you can afford to take a rest when you've been working solidly for days.

Given you have so much to do, you may find yourself in your lab at 10 PM with only the glare of your computer screen to keep you company (and warm). What a lovely picture to paint. Try and avoid this as much as possible, and try and stay healthy. Easier said than done, though: I found myself doing exactly that on so many occasions I couldn't even begin to count them. These <span class="highlight">late nights are a slippery slope</span> &mdash; before you know it, your routine could be to start working at 4 PM and leave at 6 AM the following morning. That's not good! Try and keep to a sensible routine.</p>

Towards the end, I saw it in myself. I became more forgetful and a little more irritable. I usually remember things so well! What really got me after the fifth month of writing was <em>the anxiety</em> of doing <em>anything,</em> which seems to be a pretty common thing that people develop when they are under lots and lots of pressure. One month after everything has been finished off, I still feel anxious about doing things &mdash; although I am definitely getting better.</p>

I have perfectionist tendencies, and I found the writeup to be incredibly challenging, but also incredibly useful. I began to realise that there has to be a point at which you simply have to say <em>"this is good enough"</em>. That was an enlightening moment for me because I now realise that <span class="highlight">perfection is simply not possible</span>.

                        <p>Nor do the individuals in your life who you are close with really understand, either. They may not be doing a PhD, nor even be considering doing one. However, these people <em>should</em> understand that you are going to be under immense levels of stress and pressure for a considerable amount of time.

                        <div class="partial pwrapper">
                            <p>So, you have spent months working on your thesis, and your supervisor has said that it's now pretty much at a submittable state. You spend the last few days playing around with the references, tidying up the random things that were bugging you for weeks, and then you print it off. As my supervisor told me just before I was about to hand mine in for examination, it is like a million tons being lifted off of your shoulders.</p>
                            
                            <p>It really did feel that way, although as I mentioned earlier, the actual process of handing it in is so unbelievably anticlimactic. I heard that at the University of Edinburgh, they give you a lollipop at the very least. That's something. Oh well. It doesn't really matter that the party poppers don't sound for you &mdash; no, <em>you should just feel proud of reaching that moment in your life.</em> You're almost free of it! At least you can take a bit of a rest before your viva. As I'll <a href="#reflecting">write about below</a>, you should take some time to reflect on the achievement of getting to this point.</p>
                            
                            <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight"><strong>The Viva</strong></span> One thing that you still have to get through at the end is the viva. I had heard lots of scare stories about this, from people all over the world: vivas taking <em>four and a half hours</em>, or a student telling their examiner to <em>'eff off</em>. I hope that both of those were not true... but I can kind of understand with the swearing. An examiner who is critical of work you've spent years on might hit a nerve, but it is important to stay calm. They're doing their job. And you should be used to criticism when you reach your viva, anyway!</p>
                            
                            <img src="{% get_media_prefix %}things/phd/viva.jpg" alt="Success after the viva" class="float-right" />
                            
                            <p>The lead up to my viva was a bout of significant apprehension. Again, it's the culmination of years of hard work. It is perfectly understandable. I was worried that I didn't really know how to prepare for it. And because I didn't know how to properly prepare, I felt like I was going to mess it up. However, if I had taken a step back and thought about things rationally, <em>I would have realised that I had already done the preparation.</em> <span class="highlight">Writing your thesis is the perfect preparation for your viva!</span> Although it would do you no harm in picking your thesis up and reading it again beforehand, you'll be unsurprised with how much you remember &mdash; or rather, you remember <em>all of it.</em> Even down to the little details. And so I found my viva experience to be relatively straightforward, and two and half hours long. That length is pretty much the average (from what I heard) for a UK viva defence, which takes place behind closed doors.</p>
                            
                            <p>While writing your thesis is the perfect preparation, you can also do little things beforehand. My supervisor was a great help. He asked me some questions, like a mock viva, in the weeks leading up to it. The answers I gave were greeted with some friendly and constructive feedback from him. Ultimately, this feedback made me realise one or two things about my work that I should sell more, and that led to a more confident performance when it really mattered.</p>

                        <p>Once you've finished everything up, I think it's really important to take a while to just stop doing anything and think about where you've got to. Put everything down and look behind you &mdash; you've ascended and successfully descended your Everest. Well done! <span class="highlight">You should feel so incredibly proud of your achievement.</span> A very small percentage of the world's population have <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/countries-with-most-doctoral-graduates/" target="_blank">attempted to do what you have achieved</a>; an even smaller percentage actually <a href="https://finishyourthesis.com/drop-out/" target="_blank">did succeed!</a></p>

                            It is a very good point to look back. Recognise the work I did. Feel proud of it. Feel amazed at what I found interesting and important three years ago.

                        <p>That's a quote from my friend who is now a successful academic, three years after successfully defending his PhD. Although I'm sure the achievement wears off a little bit as you move on throughout your life, I'm sure you'll never forget the sheer amount of effort, courage and determination it took to get you that qualification.</p>
                        
                        </div>
                        <div class="partial pwrapper">
                        
                        <p>I think it'll do you the world of good to take a rest after everything is done, too &mdash; of course, only if you can afford to do so. You'll be worn out and looking for time to yourself. I have found it incredibly hard to remember what it was like to have a life before the PhD, and it really does take months for you to get back on your feet after everything is over. My advice for you in that phase is to just be kind to yourself, and know that there are now so many opportunities that have opened up for you with this degree. They'll come to you in time.</p>
                        
                        <span class="sidenote">Try and take a rest after everything is finished, if you can. You deserve it.</span>
                        
                        <p class="big-gap"><span class="highlight">So, what am I trying to tell you?</span> For one, it's absolutely worth the sacrifice. You'll feel so damn proud of yourself at the end. The skill set you develop will be incredibly useful to you going forward. Everyone in my unscientific survey agreed: writing up was a tough experience, but the result is something to be happy with.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            With hindsight, the scale of the writing and challenges probably set me up really well for what I do now. The thesis writing experience &mdash; and indeed, PhD as a whole &mdash; has undoubtedly helped me for that.
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            If successful, once you have been broken [by the PhD and writeup], a whole new person will emerge. You will be unmeasurably stronger, more resilient, and ready to take on any challenge life will send your way.
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>But what I've tried to articulate on this page is just how challenging that it can be. For some, it'll be straightforward &mdash; but I am sure that for a majority, it'll be the toughest thing they will ever do. I wanted to open your eyes to the challenges that you will face, and just tell you straight without sugar coating over anything.</p>
                        
                        <p>You need to be ready for something that is likely to take you months to get to a good standard. You need to be ready for long, lonely writing sessions. You need to be ready for the horrible moments when you realise you need to run that experiment again or re-write that entire section. You need to have an understanding that the pressure may temporarily get the better of you, and you may face problems outside of your writeup, <em>because</em> of your writeup.</p>
                        
                        <p>Try not to be too disheartened when things do go wrong, because you will be able to fix them. <strong>And start thinking about (and writing!) your thesis early.</strong> Don't leave this to the last minute, because I am sure that you will quickly come to regret it.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>If you're in doubt about something, talk to your supervisor. Get it sorted quickly. It'll make life easier if you deal with the issue swiftly.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="highlight">Good luck to you!</span> And remember:</p>
